**👨‍💻 My services** 

Do you need an eCommerce website or custom Shopify development?
Unlike other developers, I only work with Shopify and my focus areas are store setups and theme development.<br /><br />
Did you work with other Developers/Designers who were not able to fix your issues? [Contact me!](https://google.com) I can help and if I can't, no worries.<br /> There will be no charges made. I will make sure you are happy with the outcome before getting billed.<br /><br />
Here are some common tasks I’m asked to help with, but really anything you might need assistance with I can help.

> 🏪 Complete store setups
 > 
> 🧭 Store migrations (Woo-commerce, Big Commerce ...)
 > 
> 🎨 Theme customizations
 > 
> ⚙️ Third-party app integrations
 > 
> 🚀 Performance Optimizations
